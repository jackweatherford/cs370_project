Team Name: Sound Mixers

Project Name: SoundBoard App
 
Description: 
Our app will be able to play and record audio by the user. It will have at least one track player to cue sounds bites one after the other, and it will also be able to cut and edit these bites. It will also have buttons that can be tied to a certain audio bites, for custom use.
We will be using Android Studio to develop the app. We will probably develop our own APIs, but there could libraries out there to help with our audio specific needs.
